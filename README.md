# Lyme Disease and Climate in the City of Toronto
With zoonotic diseases growing as a public health concern alongside a warming climate, the connection between environmental and human health is stark. Through this data analytics project, I wanted to answer the question, "Is there a correlation between the number of cases of Lyme disease and min/max/mean temperatures in the City of Toronto?"
<p>Key finding: Using time-series correlation, there is a moderate correlation (r â‰ˆ 0.67) between the average temperature during one month and the number of Lyme disease cases three months later.</p>
<p>Future directions for this project:</p>
<p>1. Analyzing this alongside more granular public health data (e.g. including demographics).</p>
<p>2. Analyzing different geographic areas, especially major cities that report high temperatures.</p>
<p>3. Comparing this to other zoonotic diseases (anthrax, West Nile virus, etc.).</p>
