# From Degrees to Disease: Investigating Temperature and Lyme Cases in Toronto
With zoonotic diseases growing as a public health concern alongside a warming climate, the connection between environmental and human health is stark. Through this data analytics project, I wanted to answer the question, "Is there a correlation between the number of cases of Lyme disease and min/max/mean temperatures in the City of Toronto?"
<p>Key findings: Using time-series correlation, there is a moderate correlation (r ≈ 0.63) between the average temperature during one month and the number of Lyme disease cases three months later. In contrast, the maximum and minimum temperature values during a given month are correlated with the Lyme disease cases within that month. Maximum temperature values have the highest correlation (r ≈ 0.73), while the minimum temperature values were slightly less correlated (r ≈ 0.69). This underlies the need for enhanced public health strategies to mitigate climate-influenced health risks in metropolitan areas like Toronto.</p>
<p>Future directions for this project:</p>
<p>1. Analyzing this alongside more granular public health data (e.g. including demographics).</p>
<p>2. Analyzing different geographic areas, especially major cities that report high temperatures.</p>
<p>3. Comparing this to other zoonotic diseases (anthrax, West Nile virus, etc.).</p>
